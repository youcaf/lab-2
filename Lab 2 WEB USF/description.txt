	I have done this tasks mostly using the div's. i have created a tab bar of images using the anchor tag and directed each
image to a div using href=#(ImageReference). 
	I have made this page responsive by using the width property in every div tag thats is used for showing each of the image
when clicked from tab bar.
	I used button for next and precious image and also direct the image previous and next to current image using href=#imagereference.
